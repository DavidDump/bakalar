## x86 architecture
x86 is a family of instruction set architectures (ISAs) based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor, which was introduced in 1978. It has since become the most used CPU architecture for computers. x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture, meaning it has numerous instructions, where a single instruction can be implemented using multiple low-level operations. Instructions are variable-length, the architecture is stack-based that supports both 16-bit and 32-bit addressing modes. The architecture also includes numerous specialized instructions for tasks such as floating-point arithmetic, string manipulation, and memory management. The architecture ensures backwards compatibility, allowing software designed for older x86 processors to run on newer ones. It also has multiple operating modes, including real mode and protected mode.

The newer x86-64 ISA was introduced by AMD, to support 64-bit addressing mode, along with a 4-level paging mode. This allows for more virtual and physical memory to be used by the processor.

### Anatomy of an Instruction
x86 is a variable length instruction set, meaning that each instruction can have a different length. The processor has no way of knowing the length of the instruction it is about to read, only by reading and processing the bytes does it know when it reaches the end of an instruction.
A single instruction has a size limit of 15 bytes.
