Sometimes multiple mnemonics have the same condition, this is because all those instructions generate the same bytecode and can therefore be considered identical.

### Memory I/O Instrucions
The only instruction that is necessary for memory I/O is the `MOV` instruction. This instruction can store an immediate value in a register or a memory location. It can also move values stored in a register to other registers or memory locations, or vice versa. The destination is the first operand, followed by the source.
```asm
; stores 1 in rax
MOV rax, 1

; copies the value from rax to rbx
MOV rbx, rax

; copies the value from rax
; to at the memory location pointed to by rbp - 8
MOV [rbp - 8], rax

; copies the value from the memory location
; pointed to by rbp - 16 to rax
MOV rax, [rbp - 16]
```
Despite its name the instruction doesn't move the data, it copies it, the data at the source location remains intact.
