These instructions follow the same pattern in their syntax, the first operand is the destination and the second is the source. In the following examples `rax` contains 34 and `rbx` contains 35.
#### AND example:
```asm
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; AND ----------
;      0b100010
AND rax, rbx    ; rax = rax & rbx
```
#### OR example:
```asm
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; OR  ----------
;      0b100011
OR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax | rbx
```
#### XOR example:
```asm
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; XOR ----------
;      0b000001
XOR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax ^ rbx
```

The NOT instruction only has one operand, it simply inverts all the bits.
```asm
MOV rax, 42     ; 0b101010
NOT rax         ; after the instruction rax will contain 0b010101
```

### Shift Instructions
Shift instructions shift the bits in a register, or memory location to the left or right. There are two types of shift instructions: regular (`SHL`, `SHR`) and arithmetic (`SAL`, `SAR`). Both regular and arithmetic shifts behave the same way when shifting to the left, the LSB that is introduced is always a `0`. When shifting to the right a regular shift will introduce `0`-s, while an arithmetic shift will preserve the sign bit.
The operands can be specified in two ways. The first operand is always the target register or memory location. This is where the bits are stored after the instruction. The second operand can be an 8 bit number or the `cl` register. If it is a number `n`, then the target bits will be shifted `n` bits. If the parameter is the `cl` register, then the value `n` is read from `cl`.
Shifting to the left is also equivalent to multiplying by two, and shifting to the right is the equivalent to dividing by two. When multiplying or dividing signed or unsigned number the arithmetic or regular shifts need to be used respectively for the result to be correct. These instructions are often used for optimizing division or multiplication by powers of two, as these instructions are faster than the regular `DIV` and `MUL` instructions.

Examples of using shift instructions:
```asm
; shift bits in rax to the right by one, shift in a 0 bit
SHR rax, 1

; shift bits in rbx to the left the amount stored in cl,
; shift in a 0 bit
SAL rbx, cl

; shift bits at the memory location
; that is stored in rbp - 8 to the right,
; shift in the same bit as MSB
SAR QWORD [rbp - 8], 2
```

### Flow Control Instructions
Flow control instructions modify the value stored in the `rip`, the instruction pointer register. This allows the CPU to execute instructions in a different order than it is stored in the memory. The `JMP` (jump) instruction is the simplest flow control instruction. The `JMP` instruction takes one argument, the memory address that is stored in the `rip` register as the target address.
```asm
jmp 0xFFFF ; jumps to the absolute address of 0xFFFF
```
A different form of the `JMP` instruction is the conditional jump, this group of instructions also performs a jump to a target address, but only if a certain condition is met. All the conditions are related to the `EFLAGS` register, and are true if one or more flags in the `EFLAGS` register are set, depending on the instruction.
The various flags that are stored in the `EFLAGS` register are set based on the result of the last arithmetic operation performed. The flags are:
