Performing an arithmetic operation and overwriting a value stored in a register just to set the correct `EFLAGS` for a conditional jump is not always desirable. The `CMP` instruction can be used to compare two values, throw away the result but stil set the `EFLAGS` register flags based on the result. The `CMP` instruction takes two parameters and subtracts one the second from the first and discards the result.

After the `CMP` instruction one of the conditional jumps can be called to perform a jump based on the result of the comparison. The various conditional jumps are:
