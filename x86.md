## x86 architecture
x86 is a family of instruction set architectures (ISAs) based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor, which was introduced in 1978. It has since become the most used CPU architecture for computers. x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture, meaning it has a large number of instructions, where a single instructions can execute several low-level operations. Instructions are variable-length, the architecture is stack-based that supports both 16-bit and 32-bit addressing modes. The architecture also includes a large number of specialized instructions for tasks such as floating-point arithmetic, string manipulation, and memory management. The architecture ensures backwards compatibility, allowing software designed for older x86 processors to run on newer ones. It also has multiple operating modes, including real mode and protected mode.

The newer x86-64 ISA introduced support for 64-bit addressing mode, along with a 4-level paging mode. This allows for more virtual and physical memory to be used by the processor.

### Anatomy of an Instruction
x86 is a varriable length instrucion set, meaning that each instruction can have a different length. The processor has no way of knowing the length of the instruction its about to read, only by reading and processing the bytes does it know when it reaches the end of an instrucion.
A single instrucion has a size limit of 15 bytes.

|Rex prefix|Opcode|ModR/M|SIB|Displacement|Immediate|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1 byte|1-3 bytes|1 byte|1 byte|1-4 bytes|1-8 bytes|
|optional||optional|optional|optional|optional|
: Instructions

- **ModR/M byte**: The ModR/M (Register/Memory) byte consists of 3 parts in the following order: `mod` (2 bits), the `reg` (3 bits) and the `rm` (3 bits) parts. 
  - `reg` and `rm`: There are 8 addressable registers in 32-bit mode, each represented by a 3 bit number: `eax` (0), `ecx` (1), `edx` (2), `ebx` (3), `esp` (4), `ebp` (5), `esi` (6), `edi` (7). These numbers are used in the `rm` and `reg`, to encode the two operands of the instuction. Whether `rm` or `reg` is used as the first or the second operand is determined by the opcode.
  - `mod`: Each instruction that usees `rm` to address an operand, can have 4 addressing modes. These modes are:
    - Direct: The value stored in `rm` is used as an operand, `mod == 3`
    - Indirect: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 0`
    - Indirect with 8 bit offset: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, the offset is added to it, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 1`
    - Indirect with 32 bit offset: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, the offset is added to it, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 2`
    ```
    PUSH, eax            ; mod == 3, direct addressing
    PUSH, [eax]          ; mod == 0, indirect addressing without offset
    PUSH, [eax + 0x12]   ; mod == 1, indirect addressing with 8 bit offset
    PUSH, [eax + 0x1234] ; mod == 2, indirect addressing with 32 bit offset
    ```
  - `reg` opcode extention: If the instrucion only uses one operand, `reg` can be used to extend the opcode. In this case `reg` doesn't contain a register but an opcode extention instead.
- **Opcode**: This byte stores the opcode of the instruction. Some instructions that address only one register, use the bottom 3 bits to store that register, removing the need for a `ModR/M` byte.
- **SIB byte**: A `SIB` (Scale Index Base) byte can only be present if a `ModR/M` byte is also present in the instrucion. The `SIB` byte consists of the following parts: `scale` (2), `index` (3) and `base` (3). This byte indicates one of the operands will have the following form:
  ```
  [base + index * scale]
  ```
  Similar to the `ModR/M` byte, `index` and `base` store values coresponding to registers in the same form as in the ModR/M byte. `scale` can be one of the following values:
  - `scale == 0`: The index will be multiplied by 1
  - `scale == 1`: The index will be multiplied by 2
  - `scale == 2`: The index will be multiplied by 4
  - `scale == 3`: The index will be multiplied by 8
- **REX prefix**: This byte is used in 64-bit mode to extend the number of addressable register. The top 4 bits have to be set to `0b0100`. The bottom 4 bits consist of the following one bit parts: `W`, `R`, `X`, `B`. These bits are used to extend the existing register values. The additional register that can be specified using this byte are: `r8` (8), `r9` (9), `r10` (10), `r11` (11), `r12` (12), `r13` (13), `r14` (14), `r15` (15).
  - `W`: This bit is set when the operand size is 64 bits.
  - `R`: If `reg` contains an operand register the `R` bit is used to extend it.
  - `X`: If `index` contains an operand register the `X` bit is used to extend it.
  - `B`: This bit can extend either `rm` or `base`, depending on what type of addressing is used.
- **Displacement**: Displacement (offset) is the value added to the register in `rm`, in case of `mod == 1` or `mod == 2`.
- **Immediate**: The immediate data value used, if one of the operands is an immediate (literal).

### Registers
The registers used in the `ModR/M` and `SIB` bytes can be one of 16 values. The number `0` always corresponds to the `a` register, but the size of the register can vary:
- `al`/`ah` for 8 bit
- `ax` for 16 bit
- `eax` for 32 bit
- `rax` for 64 bit

<!-- NOTE: prefix for 16 bit operands: 0x66 if operand, 0x67 if address -->
In order to target these registers different size override prefixes need to be used. Every single version of the `a` register overlaps, meaning the 32 bits of the `eax` register, are also the bottom 32 bits of the 64 bit `rax` register. Storing a value in the smaller registers will not override the upper bits of the larger registers if the target register is 8 or 16 bits. When storing a value in a 32 bit register, the upper 64 bits of the corresponding 64 bit register will be set to 0.

### Syntax
x86 assmebly language has two main dialects: Intel syntax and AT&T syntax. Intel syntax is mainly used in the Windows world, and AT&T syntax is dominant in the Unix world, since Unix was created at AT&T Bell Labs. The main differences are:

- **Registers and literals**
  - AT&T: Registers are prefixed with % (`%rax`), literals are prefixed with $ (`$5`).
  - Intel: Neither registers nor literals are prefixed.
- **Parameter order**
  - AT&T: Source before the destination: `MOVQ $5, %rax`
  - Intel: Destination before the source: `MOV rax, 5`
- **Parameter size**
  - AT&T: Mnemonics are suffixed with a letter indicating the size of the operands: \
  q - 64 bits \
  l - 32 bits \
  w - 16 bits \
  b - 8 bits
  ```
  MOVQ $0x24, %rax ; 0x24 is a 64 bit literal
  MOVL $0x24, %eax ; 0x24 is a 32 bit literal
  MOVW $0x24, %ax  ; 0x24 is a 16 bit literal
  MOVB $0x24, %al  ; 0x24 is a 8  bit literal
  ```
  - Intel: Derived from the name of the register used: \
  `rax` - 64-bit \
  `eax` - 32-bit \
  `ax` - 16-bit \
  `ah`/`al` - 8-bit
  ```
  MOV rax, 0x24 ; 0x24 is a 64 bit literal
  MOV eax, 0x24 ; 0x24 is a 32 bit literal
  MOV ax, 0x24  ; 0x24 is a 16 bit literal
  MOV al, 0x24  ; 0x24 is a 8  bit literal
  ```
- **Effective addresses**
  - AT&T: General syntax is `DISPLACEMENT_TYPE(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)`. In this example the displacement type "offset" is used the calculate the address for `%rbx + %rcx * 4`: \
  `MOVQ offset(%rbx, %rcx, 4), %rax`
  - Intel: Arithmetic expressions in square brackets. Size keywords like "byte", "word", "dword" or "qword" have to be used if the size cannot be determined from the operands.
  ```
  ; in this example no size specifier is required,
  ; as the size of the argument can be infered
  ; from the register name
  MOV rax, [ebx + ecx * 4]

  ; in this example the `QWORD` size specifier
  ; is required as there is no register in the arguments,
  ; so the size of the literal is uncertaint
  MOV QWORD [ebx + ecx * 4], 1
  ```

The examples below will use Intel syntax.

### Arithmetic Instrucions
The processor has a component called the `ALU` (Arithmetic Logic Unit), that is capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations on some data. The most basic ones include: addition `ADD`, subtraction `SUB`, multiplications `MUL`, division `DIV`. The `ADD` and `SUB` operations require two opearands, the source and the destination:
```
ADD rax, rbx    ; rax = rax + rbx
SUB rax, rbx    ; rax = rax - rbx
```
The `MUL` instructions only requires one operand, as the `rax` register is impicitly used as one of the operands of the multiplication. As both the operands of the instruction are 64-bit registers the result can overflow by more that just one bit. For this reason the result is stored in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in `rdx` and the lower bits in `rax`.
```
MUL rbx         ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
```
The `DIV` instruction is the inverse of `MUL` so the input is given in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in `rdx` and the lower in `rax`. The instruction only takes one operand, the divisor. After the operation is performed the result is stored in two registers, `rax` will contain the whole part of the result and `rdx` will conaint the ramainder of the division.
```
DIV rcx         ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
Furthermore both the `MUL` and the `DIV` instructions have a signed version. These instructions behave the same as their unsigned counterpart with the only differnce being that the result will have the correct sign in case of performing the opration on a positive and a negative number.
```
IMUL rbx        ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
IDIV rcx        ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
The `ADD` and `SUB` instructions dont have a separate signed version as the sign of the result will be correct when performing these operations on either signed or unsigned operands, provided that both operands are of the same signedness.

Often when iterating over elemnts, or counting something, the `ADD rax, 1` instruction would be performed, for this purpouse the `INC` instruction can be used. It only takes one operand that it increments by one.

The inverse of this instruction `DEC` is also an instruction, similarly to `INC` it also only takes one operand, that it then decrements.

Example of usage of these two instructions:
```
INC rax
DEC rbx
```

### Logical Instrucions
Logical instructions perform operations on the individual bits of the operands.

The AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^) instructions each take two operands that they compare bit by bit and set the result bit based on a truth table:

|A|B|A & B|A &#124; B|A ^ B|
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|1|1|
|1|0|0|1|1|
|1|1|1|1|0|

: Truth table of the AND, OR, XOR opeartions

These instructions follow the same pattern in their syntax, the first operand is the destination and the second is the source. In the following examples `rax` contains 34 and `rbx` contains 35.
#### AND example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; AND ----------
;      0b100010
AND rax, rbx    ; rax = rax & rbx
```
#### OR example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; OR  ----------
;      0b100011
OR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax | rbx
```
#### XOR example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; XOR ----------
;      0b000001
XOR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax ^ rbx
```

The NOT instrucion only has one operand, it simply inverts all the bits.
```
MOV rax, 42     ; 0b101010
NOT rax         ; after the instruction rax will contain 0b010101
```

### Shift Instructions
Shift instructions shift the bits in a register, or memory location to the left or right. There are two types of shift instructions: regular (`SHL`, `SHR`) and arithmetic (`SAL`, `SAR`). Both regular and arithmetic shifts behave the same way when shifting to the left, the LSB that is shifter in is always a `0`. When shifting to the right a regular shift will shift in a `0`, an arithmetic shift will shift in the sign bit.
The operands can be specified in two ways. The first operand is always the target register or memory location. This is were the bits are stored that will be shifted. The second operand can be a 8 bit number or the `cl` register. If it is a number the target bits will be shifted this number of times. If its the `cl` register the value stored in the register is how many times the bits will be shifted.
Shifting to the left is also equivalent to multiplying by two, and shifting to the right is the equivalent to dividing by two. When multiplying or dividing signed or unsigned number the arithmeric or regular shifts need to be used respectively for the result to be correct. These instruction are ofter used for optimizing division or multiplication by a multiple of two, as these instructions are faster than the regular `DIV` and `MUL` instructions.

Examples of using shift instructions:
```
; shift bits in rax to the right by one, shift in a 0 bit
SHR rax, 1

; shift bits in rbx to the left the amount stored in cl,
; shift in a 0 bit
SAL rbx, cl

; shift bits at the memory location
; that is stored in rbp - 8 to the right,
; shift in the same bit as MSB
SAR QWORD [rbp - 8], 2
```

### Flow Control Instrucions
Flow control instructions modify the value stored in the `rip`, instruction pointer, register. This allows the CPU to execute instructions in a different order than it is stored in memory. The `JMP` (jump) instruction is the simplest flow control instruction. The `JMP` instruction takes one argument, the memory address that should be stored in the `rip` register, or simply put, the target address where it should jump to.
```
jmp 0xFFFF ; jumps to the absolute address 0xFFFF
```
A different form of the `JMP` istruction is the conditional jump, this group of instructions also performs a jump to a target address, but only if a certaint condition is met. All the conditions are related to the `EFLAGS` register, and are true if one or more flags in the `EFLAGS` register are set, depending on the instruction.
The various flags that are stored in the `EFLAGS` register are set based on the result of the  last arithmetic operation performed. The flags are:

|Shorthand Name|Flag name|Flag description|
|---|---|---|
|OF|Overflow Flag|Set if operation overflowed|
|CF|Carry Flag|Set if operation has the carry bit set|
|ZF|Zero Flag|Set if operation result was zero|
|SF|Sign Flag|Set if operation has the negative sign set|
|PF|Parity Flag|Set if operation has an even number of 1 bits|

: EFLAGS register flags

Performing an arithmetic operation and overwriting a value stored in a register just to set the correct `EFLAGS` for a conditional jump is not always desirable. The `CMP` instruction can be used to compare two values, throw away the result but stil set the `EFLAGS` register flags based on the result. The `CMP` instruction takes two parameters and subtracts one the second from the first and discards the result.

After the `CMP` instruction one of the conditional jumps can be called to perform a jump based on the result of the comparison. The various conditional jumps are:

|Mnemonic|Description|Condition|
|---|---|---|
|JA|jump if above|CF == 0 && ZF == 0|
|JNBE|jump if not below or equal|CF == 0 && ZF == 0|
|JAE|jump if above or equal|CF == 0|
|JNB|jump if not below|CF == 0|
|JNC|jump if not carry|CF == 0|
|JB|jump if below|CF == 1|
|JC|jump if carry|CF == 1|
|JNAE|jump if not above or equal|CF == 1|
|JBE|jump if below or equal|CF == 1 && ZF == 1|
|JNA|jump if not above|CF == 1 && ZF == 1|
|JCXZ|jump if `cx` zero|CX == 0|
|JECXZ|jump if `ecx` zero|ECX == 0|
|JRCXZ|jump if `rcx` zero|RCX == 0|
|JE|jump if equal|ZF == 1|
|JZ| jump if zero|ZF == 1|
|JG|jump if greater|ZF == 0 && SF == OF|
|JNLE|jump if not less or equal|ZF == 0 && SF == OF|
|JGE|jump if greater or equal|SF == OF|
|JNL|jump if not less|SF == OF|
|JL|jump if less|SF != OF|
|JNGE|jump if not greater of equal|SF != OF|
|JLE|jump if less or equal|ZF == 1 && SF != OF|
|JNG|jump if not greater|ZF == 1 && SF != OF|
|JNE|jump if not equal|ZF == 0|
|JNZ|jump if not zero|ZF == 0|
|JNO|jump if not overflow|OF == 0|
|JNP|jump if no parity|PF == 0|
|JPO|jump if parity odd|PF == 0|
|JNS|jump if no sign|SF == 0|
|JO|jump if overflow|OF == 1|
|JP|jump if parity|PF == 1|
|JPE|jump if parity even|PF == 1|
|JS|jump if sign|SF == 1|

: Conditional jump instructions

Sometimes multiple mnemonics have the same condition, this is because all those instructions generate the same bytecode and can therefore be considered identical.

### Memory I/O Instrucions
The only instruction that is necessary for memory I/O is the `MOV` instruction. This instruction can store an immediate value in a register or a memory location. It can also move values stored in a register to other registers or memory locations, or vice versa. The destination is the first operand, followed by the source.
```
; stores 1 in rax
MOV rax, 1

; copies the value from rax to rbx
MOV rbx, rax

; copies the value from rax
; to at the memory location pointed to by rbp - 8
MOV [rbp - 8], rax

; copies the value from the memory location
; pointed to by rbp - 16 to rax
MOV rax, [rbp - 16]
```
Despite its name the instruction doesn't move the data, it copies it, the data at the source location remains intact.
