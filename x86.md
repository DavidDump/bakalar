# x86 architecture
some history about the architecture, maybe about the itanium and how Intel was unable to standardize a new ISA despite spending millions on it. readining about the instructions and why some exist, explain what is the purpose of some instructions. some closing thoughts that summarize the section.

Explain how the architecture works, how instructions are encoded, maybe some datail about x86 thats needed to understand how certaint instructions work.

## Anatomy of an instruction
x86 is a varriable length instrucion set, meaning each instruction can have a different length. The processor has no way of knowing the length of the instruction its about to read, only by reading and processing the bytes does it know when it reaches the end of an instrucion.
A single instrucion has a size limit of 15 bytes.
|||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Rex prefix|Opcode|ModR/M|SIB|Displacement|Immediate|
|1 byte <br> optonal|1-3 bytes|1 byte <br> optional|1 byte <br> optional|1-4 bytes <br> optional|1-8 bytes <br> optional|

- **ModR/M byte**: The ModR/M byte consists of 3 "fields" in this order: the mod(2 bits), the reg(3 bits) and the rm(3 bits) field. 
  - Reg and RM fields: There are 8 addressable registers in 32-bit mode, each represented by a 3 bit number: eax(0), ecx(1), edx(2), ebx(3), esp(4), ebp(5), esi(6), edi(7). These numbers are used in the rm and reg field to encode the two operands of the instuction. Whether the rm or reg field is used as the first of second operand is determined by the opcode.
  - Mod field: The mod field is used to indicate the addressing mode:
    ```
    PUSH, eax             ; mod = 3, direct addressing
    PUSH, [eax]           ; mod = 0, indirect addressing without displacement
    PUSH, [eax + 0x12]    ; mod = 1, indirect addressing with 8 bit displacement
    PUSH, [eax + 0x1234]  ; mod = 2, indirect addressing with 32 bit displacement
    ```
  - Reg field extention: If the instrucion only uses one operand the reg field can be used to extend the opcode. In this case the reg field doesnt contain a register but a opcode extention instead.
- **Displacement**: Displacement is the value added to the register in the rm field of the ModR/M byte, in case of mod = 1 or mod = 2.
- **Opcode**: The opcode of the instruction, some instructions that address only one register, use the bottom 3 bits to store that register, removing the need for a ModR/M byte.
- **SIB byte**: A SIB byte can only be present if a ModR/M byte is also presend in the instrucion. The SIB byte follows a similar layout to the ModR/M byte only with the following fields: scale(2), index(3), base(3). This byte indicates one of the operands will have the following form:
  ```
  PUSH [base + index * scale]
  ```
  Base and index are register given in the same form as in the ModR/M byte. The scale can be one of the following values:
  - X1: scale = 0
  - X2: scale = 1
  - X4: scale = 2
  - X8: scale = 3
- **REX prefix**: The REX prefix is used in 64-bit mode to extend the number of addressable register. The top 4 bits have to be set to 0b0100. The bottom 4 bits specify the following one bit fields: W, R, X, B. These fields are used to extend the existing register locations. The new registers are as follows: r8(8), r9(9), r10(10), r11(11), r12(12), r13(13), r14(14), r15(15)
  - W field: The W field is set when the operand size is 64 bits.
  - R field: If the reg field of the ModR/M byte contains an operand register the R field is used to extend it.
  - X field: If the index field of the SIB byte contains an operand register the X field is used to extend it.
  - B field: This field can extend either the rm field of the ModR/M byte, or the base field of the SIB byte, depending on what type of addressing is used.
- **Immediate**: The immediate data value used, if one of the operands is an immediate (literal).

## Syntax
x86 assmebly language has two main forms of syntax: Intel syntax and AT&T syntax. Intel syntax is mainly used in the Windows world, and AT&T syntax is dominant in the Unix world, since Unix was created at AT&T Bell Labs. The main differences are:
||AT&T|Intel|
|---|---|---|
|Registers and literals|Registers are prefixed with % (%rax), literals are prefixed with $ ($5).|Neither registers nor literals are prefixed.|
|Parameter order|`MOVQ $5, %rax` <br> Source before the destination.|`MOV rax, 5` <br> Destination before source.|
|Parameter size|`MOVL $0x24, %eax` <br> Mnemonics are suffixed with a letter indicating the size of the operands: <br> q - 64-bits <br> l - 32-bits <br> w - 16-bits <br> b - 8-bits.|`MOV eax, 0x24` <br> Derived from the name of the register used. <br> rax - 64-bit <br> eax - 32-bit <br> ax - 16-bit <br> ah/al - 8-bit|
|Effective addresses|`MOVQ offset(%rbx, %rcx, 4), %rax` <br> General syntax: DISPLACEMENT(BASE, INDEX, SCALE) <br> In this example the displacement type "offset" is used the calculate the address for: %rbx + %rcx * 4|`MOV rax, [ebx + ecx * 4]` <br> Arithmetic expressions in square brackets. Size keywords like "byte", "word", "dword" or "qword" have to be used if the size cannot be determined from the operands.|

In the examples I will be using Intel syntax.
## Registers
TODO: something about registers

## Arithmetic instrucions
The processor has a component called the ALU (arithmetic logic unit), that is capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations on some data. The most basic ones include: addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), multiplications (MUL), division (DIV). The ADD and SUB operations require two opearands, the source and the destination:
```
ADD rax, rbx    ; rax = rax + rbx
SUB rax, rbx    ; rax = rax - rbx
```
The MUL instructions only requires one operand, as the RAX register is impicitly used as one of the operands of the multiplication. As both the operands of the instruction are 64-bit registers the result can overflow by more that just one bit. For this reason the result is stored in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in RDX and the lower bits in RAX.
```
MUL rbx         ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
```
The DIV instruction is the inverse of MUL so the input is given in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in RDX and the lower in RAX. The instruction only takes one operand, the divisor. After the operation is performed the result is stored in two registers, RAX will contain the whole part of the result and RDX will conaint the ramainder of the division.
```
DIV rcx         ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
Furthermore both the MUL and the DIV instructions have a signed version. These instructions behave the same as their unsigned counterpart with the only differnce being that the result will have the correct sign in case of performing the opration on a positive and a negative number.
```
IMUL rbx        ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
IDIV rcx        ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
The ADD and SUB instructions dont have a separate signed version as the sign of the result will be correct when performing these operations on either signed or unsigned operands, provided that both operands are of the same signedness.

Often when iterating over elemnts, or counting something, the `ADD rax, 1` instruction would be performed, for this purpouse the INC instruction can be used. It only takes one operand that it increments by one.

The inverse of this instruction DEC is also an instruction, similarly to INC it also only takes one operand, that it then decrements.

Example of usage of these two instructions:
```
INC rax
DEC rbx
```

## Logical instrucions
Logical instructions perform operations on the individual bits of the operands.

The AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^) instructions each take two operands that they compare bit by bit and set the result bit based on a truth table:
|A|B|A & B|A \| B|A ^ B|
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|1|1|
|1|0|0|1|1|
|1|1|1|1|0|

These instructions follow the same pattern in their syntax, the first operand is the destination and the second is the source. In the following examples rax contains 34 and rbx contains 35.
#### AND example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; AND ----------
;      0b100010
AND rax, rbx    ; rax = rax & rbx
```
#### OR example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; OR  ----------
;      0b100011
OR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax | rbx
```
#### XOR example:
```
; 34 = 0b100010
; 35 = 0b100011
; XOR ----------
;      0b000001
XOR rax, rbx     ; rax = rax ^ rbx
```

The NOT instrucion only has one operand, it simply inverts all the bits.
```
MOV rax, 42     ; 0b101010
NOT rax         ; after the instruction rax will contain 0b010101
```

## Flow control instrucions
Flow control instructions modify the value stored in the RIP, instruction pointer, register. This allows the CPU to execute instructions in a different order than it is stored in memory. The JMP (jump) instruction is the simplest flow control instruction. The JMP instruction takes one argument, the memory address that should be stored in the RIP register, or simply put, the target address where it should jump to.
```
jmp 0xFFFF ; jumps to the absolute address 0xFFFF
```
A different form of the JMP istruction is the conditional jump, this group of instructions also performs a jump to a target address, but only if a certaint condition is met. All the conditions are related to the EFLAGS register, and are true if one or more flags in the EFLAGS register are set, depending on the instruction.
The various flags that are stored in the ELFAGS register are set based on the result of the  last arithmetic operation performed. The flags are:

|Shorthand Name|Flag name|Flag description|
|---|---|---|
|OF|Overflow Flag| ??? |
|CF|Carry Flag| ??? |
|ZF|Zero Flag|Set if the result of the opration was zero|
|SF|Sign Flag|Set if the result of the operation has a sign set|
|PF|Parity Flag|Set if the result of the operation has an even number of 1 bits|
<!-- TODO: add all the definitions -->

Performing an arithmetic operation and overwriting a value stored in a register just to set the correct EFLAGS for a comditional jump is not always desireable ??. THe CMP instruction can be used to compare two values, throw away the result but stil set the ELFAGS register flags based on the comparison. The CMP instruction takes to parameters and subtracts one the second from the first and discards the result.

After the CMP instruction one of the conditional jumps can be called to perform a jump based on the result of the comparison. The various conditional jumps are:

|Mnemonic|Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|JA, JNBE|jump if above, jump if not below or equal|Jump is performed if CF = 0 and ZF = 0|
|JAE, JNB, JNC|jump if above or equal, jump if not below, jump if not carry|Jump is performed if CF = 0|
|JB, JC, JNAE|jump if below, jump if carry, jump if not above or equal|Jump is performed if CF = 1|
|JBE, JNA|jump if below or equal, jump if not above|Jump is performed if CF = 1 and ZF = 1|
|JCXZ|jump if CX zero|Jump is performed if CX = 0|
|JECXZ|jump if ECX zero|Jump is performed if ECX = 0|
|JRCXZ|jump if RCX zero|Jump is performed if RCX = 0|
|JE, JZ|jump if equal, jump if zero|Jump is performed if ZF = 1|
|JG, JNLE|jump if greater, jump if not less or equal|Jump is performed if ZF = 0 and SF = OF|
|JGE, JNL|jump if greater or equal, jump if not less|Jump is performed if SF = OF|
|JL, JNGE|jump if less, jump if not greater of equal|Jump is performed if SF != OF|
|JLE, JNG|jump if less or equal, jump if not greater|Jump is performed if ZF = 1 and SF != OF|
|JNE, JNZ|jump if not equal, jump if not zero|Jump is performed if ZF = 0|
|JNO|jump if not overflow|Jump is performed if OF = 0|
|JNP, JPO|jump if no parity, jump if parity odd|Jump is performed if PF = 0|
|JNS|jump if no sign|Jump is performed if SF = 0|
|JO|jump if overflow|Jump is performed if OF = 1|
|JP, JPE|jump if parity, jump if parity even|Jump is performed if PF = 1|
|JS|jump if sign|Jump is performed if SF = 1|

Some conditions have two or more mnemonics, this is because all those instructions generate the same bytecode and can therefore be considered identical.
