remarks:
we write the source code with monospace font; syntax `` in md (backtick)
the section titles are all (significant words) caps 

you have to write in plural / first person (US, WE) / past tense

In the examples we used the Intel syntax.
or.
In the examples we have used the Intel syntax.

but you must use it consistently

lots of examples of source code
like 

hello world
euclidian algorithm, 
factorial recursive and non recursive, etc.
functions, structures, ....

parsing tree / tokens / etc
