- **ModR/M byte**: The ModR/M (Register/Memory) byte consists of 3 parts in the following order: `mod` (2 bits), the `reg` (3 bits) and the `rm` (3 bits) parts. 
  - `reg` and `rm`: There are 8 addressable registers in 32-bit mode, each represented by a 3 bit number: `eax` (0), `ecx` (1), `edx` (2), `ebx` (3), `esp` (4), `ebp` (5), `esi` (6), `edi` (7). These numbers are used in the `rm` and `reg`, to encode the two operands of the instuction. Whether `rm` or `reg` is used as the first or the second operand is determined by the opcode.
  - `mod`: Each instruction that usees `rm` to address an operand, can have 4 addressing modes. These modes are:
    - Direct: The value stored in `rm` is used as an operand, `mod == 3`
    - Indirect: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 0`
    - Indirect with 8 bit offset: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, the offset is added to it, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 1`
    - Indirect with 32 bit offset: The value stored in `rm` is used as a pointer, the offset is added to it, and the value it points to is used as an operand, `mod == 2`
    ```asm
    PUSH, eax            ; mod == 3, direct addressing
    PUSH, [eax]          ; mod == 0, indirect addressing without offset
    PUSH, [eax + 0x12]   ; mod == 1, indirect addressing with 8 bit offset
    PUSH, [eax + 0x1234] ; mod == 2, indirect addressing with 32 bit offset
    ```
  - `reg` opcode extention: If the instrucion only uses one operand, `reg` can be used to extend the opcode. In this case `reg` doesn't contain a register but an opcode extention instead.
- **Opcode**: This byte stores the opcode of the instruction. Some instructions that address only one register, use the bottom 3 bits to store that register, removing the need for a `ModR/M` byte.
- **SIB byte**: A `SIB` (Scale Index Base) byte can only be present if a `ModR/M` byte is also present in the instrucion. The `SIB` byte consists of the following parts: `scale` (2), `index` (3) and `base` (3). This byte indicates one of the operands will have the following form:
  ```
  [base + index * scale]
  ```
  Similar to the `ModR/M` byte, `index` and `base` store values coresponding to registers in the same form as in the ModR/M byte. `scale` can be one of the following values:
  - `scale == 0`: The index will be multiplied by 1
  - `scale == 1`: The index will be multiplied by 2
  - `scale == 2`: The index will be multiplied by 4
  - `scale == 3`: The index will be multiplied by 8
- **REX prefix**: This byte is used in 64-bit mode to extend the number of addressable register. The top 4 bits have to be set to `0b0100`. The bottom 4 bits consist of the following one bit parts: `W`, `R`, `X`, `B`. These bits are used to extend the existing register values. The additional register that can be specified using this byte are: `r8` (8), `r9` (9), `r10` (10), `r11` (11), `r12` (12), `r13` (13), `r14` (14), `r15` (15).
  - `W`: This bit is set when the operand size is 64 bits.
  - `R`: If `reg` contains an operand register the `R` bit is used to extend it.
  - `X`: If `index` contains an operand register the `X` bit is used to extend it.
  - `B`: This bit can extend either `rm` or `base`, depending on what type of addressing is used.
- **Displacement**: Displacement (offset) is the value added to the register in `rm`, in case of `mod == 1` or `mod == 2`.
- **Immediate**: The immediate data value used, if one of the operands is an immediate (literal).

### Registers
The registers used in the `ModR/M` and `SIB` bytes can be one of 16 values. The number `0` always corresponds to the `a` register, but the size of the register can vary:
- `al`/`ah` for 8 bit
- `ax` for 16 bit
- `eax` for 32 bit
- `rax` for 64 bit

<!-- NOTE: prefix for 16 bit operands: 0x66 if operand, 0x67 if address -->
In order to target these registers different size override prefixes need to be used. Every single version of the `a` register overlaps, meaning the 32 bits of the `eax` register, are also the bottom 32 bits of the 64 bit `rax` register. Storing a value in the smaller registers will not override the upper bits of the larger registers if the target register is 8 or 16 bits. When storing a value in a 32 bit register, the upper 64 bits of the corresponding 64 bit register will be set to 0.

### Syntax
x86 assmebly language has two main dialects: Intel syntax and AT&T syntax. Intel syntax is mainly used in the Windows world, and AT&T syntax is dominant in the Unix world, since Unix was created at AT&T Bell Labs. The main differences are:

- **Registers and literals**
  - AT&T: Registers are prefixed with % (`%rax`), literals are prefixed with $ (`$5`).
  - Intel: Neither registers nor literals are prefixed.
- **Parameter order**
  - AT&T: Source before the destination: `MOVQ $5, %rax`
  - Intel: Destination before the source: `MOV rax, 5`
- **Parameter size**
  - AT&T: Mnemonics are suffixed with a letter indicating the size of the operands: \
  q - 64 bits \
  l - 32 bits \
  w - 16 bits \
  b - 8 bits
  ```asm
  MOVQ $0x24, %rax ; 0x24 is a 64 bit literal
  MOVL $0x24, %eax ; 0x24 is a 32 bit literal
  MOVW $0x24, %ax  ; 0x24 is a 16 bit literal
  MOVB $0x24, %al  ; 0x24 is a 8  bit literal
  ```
  - Intel: Derived from the name of the register used: \
  `rax` - 64-bit \
  `eax` - 32-bit \
  `ax` - 16-bit \
  `ah`/`al` - 8-bit
  ```asm
  MOV rax, 0x24 ; 0x24 is a 64 bit literal
  MOV eax, 0x24 ; 0x24 is a 32 bit literal
  MOV ax, 0x24  ; 0x24 is a 16 bit literal
  MOV al, 0x24  ; 0x24 is a 8  bit literal
  ```
- **Effective addresses**
  - AT&T: General syntax is `DISPLACEMENT_TYPE(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)`. In this example the displacement type "offset" is used the calculate the address for `%rbx + %rcx * 4`: \
  `MOVQ offset(%rbx, %rcx, 4), %rax`
  - Intel: Arithmetic expressions in square brackets. Size keywords like "byte", "word", "dword" or "qword" have to be used if the size cannot be determined from the operands.
  ```asm
  ; in this example no size specifier is required,
  ; as the size of the argument can be infered
  ; from the register name
  MOV rax, [ebx + ecx * 4]

  ; in this example the `QWORD` size specifier
  ; is required as there is no register in the arguments,
  ; so the size of the literal is uncertaint
  MOV QWORD [ebx + ecx * 4], 1
  ```

The examples below will use Intel syntax.

### Arithmetic Instrucions
The processor has a component called the `ALU` (Arithmetic Logic Unit), that is capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations on some data. The most basic ones include: addition `ADD`, subtraction `SUB`, multiplications `MUL`, division `DIV`. The `ADD` and `SUB` operations require two opearands, the source and the destination:
```asm
ADD rax, rbx    ; rax = rax + rbx
SUB rax, rbx    ; rax = rax - rbx
```
The `MUL` instructions only requires one operand, as the `rax` register is impicitly used as one of the operands of the multiplication. As both the operands of the instruction are 64-bit registers the result can overflow by more that just one bit. For this reason the result is stored in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in `rdx` and the lower bits in `rax`.
```asm
MUL rbx         ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
```
The `DIV` instruction is the inverse of `MUL` so the input is given in two 64-bit registers, the upper bits in `rdx` and the lower in `rax`. The instruction only takes one operand, the divisor. After the operation is performed the result is stored in two registers, `rax` will contain the whole part of the result and `rdx` will conaint the ramainder of the division.
```asm
DIV rcx         ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
Furthermore both the `MUL` and the `DIV` instructions have a signed version. These instructions behave the same as their unsigned counterpart with the only differnce being that the result will have the correct sign in case of performing the opration on a positive and a negative number.
```asm
IMUL rbx        ; rdx:rax = rax * rbx
IDIV rcx        ; rax = rdx:rax / rcx, rdx = remainder
```
The `ADD` and `SUB` instructions dont have a separate signed version as the sign of the result will be correct when performing these operations on either signed or unsigned operands, provided that both operands are of the same signedness.

Often when iterating over elemnts, or counting something, the `ADD rax, 1` instruction would be performed, for this purpouse the `INC` instruction can be used. It only takes one operand that it increments by one.

The inverse of this instruction `DEC` is also an instruction, similarly to `INC` it also only takes one operand, that it then decrements.

Example of usage of these two instructions:
```asm
INC rax
DEC rbx
```

### Logical Instrucions
Logical instructions perform operations on the individual bits of the operands.

The AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^) instructions each take two operands that they compare bit by bit and set the result bit based on a truth table:
